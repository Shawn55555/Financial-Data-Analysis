# Financial-Data-Analysis

This is a financial data analysis School project:
It involves zero cupon bond prices from 1986 to 2020, with bond maturity varying from 1 to 30 years.

With reference to the powerpoint slides uploaded:
1)The project uses spot rates to plot yield curve
2)We come up with a model to predict the future yield curve using the Nelson Siegel Model (NS) and Nelson–Siegel–Svensson (NSS) model
